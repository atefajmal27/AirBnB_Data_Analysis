# AirBnB Investment Analysis

### Background:
As the reputation of a listing is solely based on guests’ reviews, it is very important to have a high review score in order to attract more customers as [reviewtrackers.com](https://www.reviewtrackers.com/blog/airbnb-reviews/) finds, “People don’t trust businesses with lower than 4-star ratings. 80% of consumers say the star ratings they trust the most are 4.0, 4.5, and 5 stars.”

Looking at the data provided, I wanted to figure out what contributes to having high review scores and find out the neighborhoods that have listings with low scores on average and invest in those neighborhoods. Also, look at highly rated listings and find out commonalities between them in amenities.

### Analysis:

Cleanliness and Communication seems to have a high correlation with the overall score.

These cities seemed to have neighborhoods with listings with low scores in cleanliness and communication.

To be more exact, these are the neighborhoods with the low scoring listings on average.

In Word 22 however, there seems to not have a high correlation between Review, communication and cleanliness score. So I would advise not to invest there given that we’re trying to capitalize on the neighborhoods with listings with weak communication and review score. 


### Conclusion:
I would advise to invest in Thawi Watthana, Bangkok; Ward 92, Cape Town; Pedra de Guaratiba, and Santissimo, Rio de Janeiro and focus on keeping the listing clean and having great communication with the guests. 

Also, consider including these amenities in the word cloud as they seems to be very common among the highly rated listings:
