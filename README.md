# AirBnB Investment Analysis (In progress)

### Background:
As the reputation of a listing is solely based on guests’ reviews, it is very important to have a high review score in order to attract more customers as [reviewtrackers.com](https://www.reviewtrackers.com/blog/airbnb-reviews/) finds, “People don’t trust businesses with lower than 4-star ratings. 80% of consumers say the star ratings they trust the most are 4.0, 4.5, and 5 stars.”

Looking at the data provided, I wanted to figure out what contributes to having high review scores and find out the neighborhoods that have listings with low scores on average and invest in those neighborhoods. Also, look at highly rated listings and find out commonalities between them in amenities.

Cleanliness and Communication seems to have a high correlation with the overall score.
